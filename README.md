# Week06-Card-Game-Unit-Tests

This is the Week 6 Final Project, a version of the card game War, played out in the console, and Unit Tests using Mocha and Chai. 

I've included my 'dirty' JS file, which is where I worked through my code, and I am happy to say that it is almost all my own code, having to look up very few things. 
It is set up to run on the 'clean' JS file, but you can switch between them if you wish.

Enjoy!
